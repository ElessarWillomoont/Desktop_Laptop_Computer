# Desktop-Laptop Computer

## Current Progress:
- The case model is nearly completed, and all mounting holes have been prepared.
- Due to the high polygon count of online models (e.g., the CPU cooler with 1.3 million faces, and the entire scene reaching 6 million faces), a significant amount of time was spent fine-tuning Blender's Decimate parameters. Eventually, the polygon count was successfully reduced to 200,000 faces, making the scene suitable for mobile devices.

## TODO:
- **Electrical design** is not yet completed.
- **Software development** is still in progress.
- **Rendering of the model** has not been done yet.
